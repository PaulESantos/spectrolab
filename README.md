# spectrolab

The package is being actively developed and parts of the *API may still change*. Youâ€™re welcome to give it a spin, but do so *at your own risk*. With that said, most parts of the package are pretty stable. Let us know if you find otherwise.

## Installation

You can install spectrolab from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annakat/spectrolab")
```

## Using `spectrolab`

This vignette [introduces spectrolab](vignettes/introduction_to_spectrolab.md), and works you through the basics of the package.

This vignette shows you how to [splice sensors](vignettes/match_sensors.pdf) using the function  `match_sensors` and details about what its arguments do. A more general processing vignette is coming soon.


We highly encourage you to read the vignette on [advanced spectrolab use](vignettes/advanced_spectrolab.md) if you're planning on contributing to or developing a package that depends on `spectrolab`.
