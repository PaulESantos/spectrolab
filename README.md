# spectrolab

The package is being actively developed and the *API will likely change*. Youâ€™re welcome to give it a spin, but do so *at your own risk*.

## Installation

You can install spectrolab from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annakat/spectrolab")
```

## Using `spectrolab`

This vignette [introduces spectrolab](vignettes/introduction_to_spectrolab.md), and works you through the basics of the package.

A vignette on how to [process spectra](vignettes/processing_spectra.md) using `spectrolab` showcases several useful features such as excluding bad measurements, smoothing and normalizing spectra among other things.

We highly encourage you to read the vignette on [advanced spectrolab use](vignettes/advanced_spectrolab.md) if you're planning on contributing to or developing a package that depends on `spectrolab`.
