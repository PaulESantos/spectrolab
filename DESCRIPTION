Description: Essential functions to process data from portable
    spectrometers. Provides the S3 class `spectra` for spectral data,
    and methods to access, plot, manipulate data, for perform jump correction,
    vector normalisation, smoothing at the sensor overlap regions, and
    filtering out bad measurements. Currently only for SVC (Spectral Vista Inc.).  
    The goal is to provide a common interface for spectra that other packages can 
    build on.
